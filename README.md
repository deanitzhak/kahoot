# Multiplayer Quiz Game (Kahoot-like)

This is a multiplayer quiz game similar to Kahoot that supports up to 5 players. 
The backend is built with Python using a TCP server, and the frontend is created with Svelte. 
The server handles HTTP-like requests over a TCP connection, 
responds with custom headers and JSON-encoded data, and manages multiple clients via threads.

## Features
- **Max Players**: 5 players per session
- **Answer Timer**: 15 seconds to submit an answer
- **Reconnect Logic**: After the quiz ends, the socket automatically closes and reopens for new players if needed.  
  If no response is received, the socket closes automatically.

## Running the Application
There are two ways to run the application: locally or using Docker and Docker Compose.

### 1. Running Locally
To run the app locally, use the bash script. Here's how:

1. **Configure the IP Address**:
   - Modify the IP address in the front-end located in `client/svelte-client/API.svelte` to match your device’s local IP address.
   - You can find your local IP by running `ip a` in your terminal.

2. **Run the Application**:
   - `./start.sh`
   - The server (backend) will run on port `5000`.
   - The Svelte front-end will be accessible at `http://<your_ip_address>:8000`.
   - The Tkinter GUI for the server will automatically open.

### 2. Running with Docker and Docker Compose
To run the app using Docker, follow these steps:

# Running the Application
   There are two ways to run the application: locally or using Docker and Docker Compose.
   1.  Running Locally
       To run the app locally, use the <start.sh> bash script. Here's how:
       1.  Configure the IP Address:
           .   Modify the IP address in the front-end located in client/svelte-client/API.
           .   svelte to match your device’s local IP address.

           .   The Svelte front-end will be accessible at http://<your_ip_address>:8000.
           .   The Tkinter GUI for the server will automatically open.
   2.  Running with Docker and Docker Compose
       To run the app using Docker, follow these steps:
           1. Stop any previous instances:
               .   docker-compose down
           2.  Build the Docker containers:
               .   docker-compose build
           3.  Start the application:
               .   docker-compose up
       The Flask app (which holds the server GUI) will be running at http://localhost:5002 or your local IP.
       The Svelte front-end will be available at http://localhost:5003.
       The TCP server will be running on port 5000.
# Components Overview
   1.  Backend (Python TCP Server)
       The backend is a TCP server that listens for incoming connections using socket.
       AF_INET (IPv4) and socket.SOCK_STREAM (TCP). 
       It manages multiple clients using threads and handles custom HTTP-like requests over a TCP connection. 
       It uses the following ports:
           .   Port 5000: TCP connection for player requests
           .   Port 5001: For server status (when running with Docker)
   
   2.  Frontend (Svelte)
           .   Port 8000 when running locally
           .   Port 5003 when running via Docker
# Server GUI
   The Tkinter-based GUI for the server opens automatically when running the app via the bash script,
   or it is hosted on Flask when running with Docker at port 5002.
# Additional Information
   After each quiz round, players can reconnect if they wish to start a new game.
   If no response is received from a player, the socket connection will automatically close after the timeout period
